## Introduction

This repository is a collection of Python solutions for the problems available on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). The problems range from easy to hard and cover various topics such as algorithms, data structures, mathematics, and more. The goal is to provide clear, efficient, and well-documented solutions that can serve as a learning resource for others.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
Hackerrank-Python-Solutions/
│
├── Algorithms/
│   ├── ProblemName1.py
│   ├── ProblemName2.py
│   └── ...
│
├── DataStructures/
│   ├── ProblemName1.py
│   ├── ProblemName2.py
│   └── ...
│
├── Mathematics/
│   ├── ProblemName1.py
│   ├── ProblemName2.py
│   └── ...
│
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

Each folder contains Python files corresponding to the problems under that category on HackerRank. The files are named after the problem for easy identification.

## Getting Started

To run any of the solutions locally, you'll need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jarvismayur/Hackerrank-Python-Solutions.git
   cd Hackerrank-Python-Solutions
   ```

2. **Install any dependencies:**

   Although most of the solutions use standard Python libraries, some problems may require additional packages. You can install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run a solution:**

   Navigate to the appropriate directory and run the Python file corresponding to the problem you want to check:

   ```bash
   python Algorithms/ProblemName1.py
   ```

## Contributing
